Witches Town is made to provide a nice place on Mastodon for queer, feminists, anarchists and stuff as well as their sympathizers. We are mostly french-speaking people but you are welcome even if you speak another language.

There is no such thing as a safe space. We exist in the real world and we all carry scars and have caused wounds. This space seeks to turn down the volume of the world outside and amplify the voices that have to fight to be heard elsewhere. This space will not be perfect. It will not always be what we wish it to be , but it will be ours together and we will work on it side by side.

Please take note that if you don't like SJWs, feminazies, antifa or whatever, it might save you some time to go somewhere else.

Some rules:

- Do not engage in harassment of any kind.
- Do not publish private conversations or DMs.
- Racial, sexist and other oppressive slurs will get you suspended, even in non-public conversations.
- You can post porn and nudity, but you must use the nsfw flag and do not post on the public timeline or you will be silenced (ask around how to make unlisted posts)

58e91c11dcd4660abedbee9b,oldbytes.space,Do you like old hardware ? Do you use them ? Perfect you're welcome here !,"Welcome !
This is an open Mastodon instance, basically.
It's run by the person you see on the right (that's me!) and for now, that's all.
There might be more admins and moderators later if the needs come but alas not yet.

I hope this instance works okay for you, and that you can find a nice and welcoming community here! Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or requests, be it about this instance, how to make your own instance, or other things not related to Mastodon.

I am actually the only sysadmin of this instance and I can't work full-time on oldbytes.space so, I will do whatever I can in a reasonable time to make it works the best it can.

Rules
This instance has some rules, of course.
First, there are the usual : no sexism, no racism, no hate speech, no LGBTQphobia, no nazis, no spam, no public unflagged porn, etc...
Then, I also believe it's important to remind you that this server was made and is run by a queer activist.
This server thrives to be inclusive, and I will ban without much regret.
People are encouraged to use the report function as they see fit, and can be confident that their complaints will be heard and dealt with in some way. I want everyone to feel safe here, and if that doesn't sound like something you like, you should probably find another server.

There's also a pretty important activism aspect of this instance.
If you're a marketer, a #digital #influencer, this is not the place for you. Not only do I feel you should not feel welcome, I intend to make you feel definitely NOT welcome.
This instance, and this entire social network in my opinion, is dedicated to reclaiming social media, decentralizing, and generally creating better and more engaging communities.
The three categories of people I mentioned earlier are not, in my opinion, working towards this goal, pretty much the opposite, and they are not welcome on this server.
Please report them if you see them.

Esta herramienta de comunicaci√≥n est√° en l√≠nea solamente por el esfuerzo de su administrador y, eventualmente, algunas personas que colaboran para que el servicio sea el mejor posible.

Entendemos que para favorecer y promover una buena comunicaci√≥n y convivencia virtual, es necesario establecer algunos criterios o pautas generales. Si alguno de ellos te parece excesivo o no est√°s de acuerdo, siempre puedes elegir alguna otra instancia de Mastodon cuyas normas se adapten mejor a tus principios.

En principio, participar en Mastodon.uy implica comprender y estar de acuerdo con las siguientes condiciones:

No est√° permitido publicar el siguiente contenido (la cuenta ser√° suspendida o eliminada inmediatamente):

    Material que contenga Pornograf√≠a infantil / Pedofilia / Gore / Snuff.
    Contenido NSFW (del ingl√©s Not Safe For Work, No Apropiado Para el Trabajo en castellano), que no sea etiquetado debidamente.
    Contenido Racista / Sexista / Homof√≥bico y cualquier otro que discrimine por cuestiones de g√©nero o de elecciones sexuales.
    Contenido Xenof√≥bico o Nazi.

Advertencia:

Se silenciar√°n (no aparecer√°n en la l√≠nea temporal p√∫blica) las cuentas que publiquen contenido NSFW (no apropiado) sin marcar dichas publicaciones con el bot√≥n de ""advertencia de contenido"". Figurar en la l√≠nea temporal p√∫blica y federada es un privilegio dado que es un espacio en com√∫n con todos los nodos.

En esta instancia de Mastodon tampoco se tolerar√°n actitudes o acciones de ‚Äúacoso‚Äù a otros usuarios, entendiendo por ‚Äúacoso‚Äù, la persistencia de un usuario por mantener alguna forma de vinculaci√≥n con otro usuario que haya expresado espec√≠ficamente no desear hacerlo.

No se tolerar√° tampoco la publicaci√≥n de contenido o mensajes destinados a molestar o provocar negativamente a otros usuarios con la finalidad de generar altercados o malentendidos intencionalmente (trollear).

No se admite de ninguna forma la publicaci√≥n de informaci√≥n personal de un usuario por parte de otro que no haya autorizado expresamente esa publicaci√≥n.

Este servidor adhiere a los principios del Software Libre y es su esp√≠ritu promoverlos. Ser un nodo m√°s de una red descentralizada y federada que respeta al usuario y no invade su privacidad, es parte de nuestro compromiso militante con esos principios.

- an activist group using Facebook. People and organisations who feel this way are our initial targets.

We are launching two new Mastodon instances for activists and campaigners to aid communication of grassroot groups; putting social media back in our hands by providing a free, unfettered home for campaigners, NGO‚Äôs and activists to communicate among their peers and beyond.

This project is a way out of the restricted, algorithmic, for-profit mediation and commercialisation of communication we increasingly experience. If you do not pay to ""boost"" each post, a Facebook page will only reach 3-6% of members. This soon becomes an expensive drain on limited NGO and activist budgets. 
Activists and campaigners alike are ready to shift their outreach away from the corporate social networks paid-per-view ‚Äúwalled gardens‚Äù.

Mastodon is the worlds largest free open source decentralised microblogging network; it‚Äôs thousands of unique, interconnected communities, filled with different people, interests, languages, and needs. 
You‚Äôre free to join any community you like, or better yet, host your own, on your own terms. It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others. 
There is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.

<li>Any posts from bot accounts (including but not limited to image bots and ""ebooks"" style bots)</li>
<li>Making large amounts of toots in short periods of time</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Our Mastodon instance federates with other instances. This means that our public toots appear on the ""federated timeline"" of any instance we're federating with. If an instance has a large amount of annoying or spam content flooding the federated timeline, the entire instance may be silenced by the admins of other instances. We want to avoid that! Please help us in this endeavor.</p>

<h2>We don't want ANY of the following content AT ALL:</h2>
<ul>
<li>any kind of sexual content involving anyone under the age of 18, including written or drawn content</li>
<li>any kind of sexual content directed at a user who has not consented to it</li>
<li>Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or any anti-semitic or pro-white supremacist content</li>
<li>pro-fascist or pro- violent nationalist content</li>
<li>Islamophobic content</li>
<li>mockery of people asking for donations</li>
<li>antagonism towards sex workers</li>
<li>content defending any of the above</li>
</ul>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Don't be an asshole, and use the CW and privacy features appropriately.</p>

Code of Conduct
The Idealish community expects that all network activities, events, and digital forums:
Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
Presume the value of others. Everyone‚Äôs ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
Don‚Äôt assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy.
Use language such as ‚Äúyes/and‚Äù, not ‚Äúno/but.‚Äù
Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.
Idealish reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies to refrain from participating in Idealish network activities, events, and digital forums.",None,['en'],"['nudity_nocw', 'nudity_all', 'pornography_nocw', 'pornography_all', 'illegalContentLinks', 'spam', 'advertising', 'spoilers_nocw']","['academia', 'activism', 'journalism', 'tech']"

This Mastodon instance is, at the present, hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) on a bare metal machine leased and operated by GekkoFyre Networks. It is operated as a SolusVM Slave with KVM as the hypervisor of choice and while we won't give out exact specifications for security reasons, know that the server has well over one hundred gigabytes of DDR3 ECC RAM, a modern Intel Xeon CPU, and large amounts of redundant storage.","Furries, otherkin, therians, and Dragonkin",['en'],"['pornography_nocw', 'illegalContentLinks', 'spam', 'advertising', 'spoilers_nocw']","['furry', 'lgbt']"
